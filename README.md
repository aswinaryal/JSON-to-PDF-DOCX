# JSON-to-PDF-DOCX
NodeJS project created to generate pdf and docx format using a json data source.


## The project uses following dependencies/libraries to generate pdf and docx formatted file using JSON datasource.
## html-pdf : to generate pdf file using html template
## JqueryWOrdExport: to generate docx format file using html template.
Note: Unfortunately, LibreOffice and, probably, other similar word processors read the output file as plain text rather than interpreting it is a document, so the output of this plugin will only work with MS Word proper.

Clone the directory into your computer and type "npm start" to get up and running
